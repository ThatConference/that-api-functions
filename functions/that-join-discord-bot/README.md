# THAT Join (v2)

beta

**that-join-discord-bot** is a service endpoint for discord interaction. It provides REST actions to set up and tear down discord voice channels which support online Activities. There is also a discord command handler for slash commands.

This is beta software and is locked to a specific guild denoted by an environment variable. The bot configuration is private to limit installs.

Currently setup as a GCP v1 function.
